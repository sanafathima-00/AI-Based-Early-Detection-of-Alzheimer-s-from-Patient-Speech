# **AI-Based Early Detection of Alzheimer’s from Patient Speech**



## Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered system for the **early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease** based on analysis of a patient's spontaneous speech. By evaluating both linguistic and acoustic patterns, the tool aims to enable non-invasive, scalable, and accessible Alzheimer's screening, particularly in low-resource or multilingual settings.

## Features

* Input: Raw or transcribed spontaneous speech samples
* Extracts linguistic (syntax, semantics) and acoustic (pitch, pause, energy) features
* Applies NLP + machine learning models for Alzheimer’s prediction
* Visualization of key features for interpretability
* Multilingual-ready architecture for wider reach
